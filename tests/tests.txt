project-setup.test.js:

Tests to verify the existence of essential folders and files.
Tests to ensure required dependencies like Express, EJS, Mocha, Chai, and the color library are correctly installed and accessible.
server.test.js:

Tests to confirm the Express server starts up without errors.
Tests to verify the root route (/) is accessible and returns the expected response (e.g., status code, content type, response body).
middleware .test.js:

Tests for custom middleware functions (e.g., error handling, logging).
Simulate error scenarios and ensure the error handling middleware captures and processes errors as expected.
Verify that the logging middleware generates logs with the correct information and level of detail.
models.test.js:

Tests for data models, especially the color palette model.
Ensure the model correctly validates color input using the color library (e.g., checks for valid hex codes, RGB values).
Test any manipulation functions defined in the model using the color library (e.g., generating lighter or darker shades, converting between color formats).
Test data integrity and ensure the model adheres to the defined schema.
Phase 2: Implementing Core Functionality

api. test.js:

Comprehensive tests for each API endpoint (GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, DELETE).
Test creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting color palettes.
Include tests for error handling and validation, especially for color input using the color library .
Mock database interactions and verify the API correctly interacts with the data layer.
forms.test.js:

Unit tests for form handling logic.
Test validation rules and ensure correct behavior with valid and invalid input.
Mock API calls and verify that form submissions trigger the appropriate API endpoint with the correct data.
Phase 3: Enhancement and Optimization

routes.test.js:

Expand existing route tests to include query parameters and route parameters.
Test filtering and sorting functionalities based on query parameters.
Verify the correct handling of route parameters for accessing specific resources.
If regex is used in routes, include tests for the regex patterns to ensure they match the intended cases.
validation.test.js:

Tests for input validation using express-validator or similar libraries.
Include specific tests for color format validation using the color library.
Test different input scenarios (valid, invalid, edge cases) and ensure the validation logic behaves as expected.
error-handling. test.js:

Trigger errors in different parts of the application and verify that the error handling middleware catches them.
Ensure appropriate error messages and HTTP status codes are returned.
Test error handling for cases specific to color manipulation or validation using the color library.
Phase 4: MongoDB Integration (Optional)

database.test.js:

Test the database connection establishment.
Test basic CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) on color palettes and color data.
Ensure data is correctly stored and retrieved according to the schema design.
data-migration.test.js:

Simulate data migration from the placeholder array to the MongoDB database.
Verify that data is accurately transferred and mapped to the database schema.
Test API interactions with the database to ensure they function correctly after the migration.
